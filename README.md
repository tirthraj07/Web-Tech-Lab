- All **Java-related assignments** (Servlets, JSP, EJB) have been developed using **Maven** as the build tool and **IntelliJ IDEA** as the IDE.
- There is **no need to install any external server** like Apache Tomcat manually, as all practicals are configured to run with **embedded web servers** such as **Jetty** or **embedded Tomcat**.
- For the **PHP assignment**, **XAMPP** has been used.  
  **XAMPP** is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the **Apache HTTP Server**, **MariaDB/MySQL**, and interpreters for **scripts written in PHP and Perl**. The **XAMPP Control Panel** allows you to start/stop Apache, MySQL, and other components quickly.

- Each assignment directory includes:
  - **Output screenshots** to visualize the result.
  - A **README.md** file explaining the objective and execution steps.
  - Therefore, you don't have to run the applications manually unless needed.
