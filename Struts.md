## Q: What is Struts?

**Struts** is an **open-source web application framework** for developing **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)** web applications. It was originally created by the **Apache Software Foundation**.

Struts is based on the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, which helps separate application logic, user interface, and data. It simplifies the development of large-scale web applications by organizing code into reusable components.

There are two main versions:

* **Struts 1**: The original version, now obsolete.
* **Struts 2**: A newer, more powerful version, built on top of **WebWork** and offering better flexibility and integration.

### Where is Struts Used?

Struts is mainly used in:

* **Java-based web applications** where separation of concerns (MVC pattern) is important.
* **Enterprise-level applications** where reusability, maintainability, and scalability are required.
* Projects that require:

  * **Form validation**
  * **Internationalization**
  * **Page navigation control**
  * **Integration with other Java technologies like Spring and Hibernate**

### MVC Structure in Struts

1. **Model**: Handles the business logic (e.g., JavaBeans, database interaction).
2. **View**: Represents the UI (typically JSP files).
3. **Controller**: The Struts **ActionServlet** acts as the controller that handles user input and forwards it to the appropriate action classes.

## Q: What is the difference between Struts 1 and Struts 2?

Struts 1 is based on MVC-1 architecture and Struts 2 is based on MVC-2 architecture. Struts 1 is action-based and Struts 2 is component-based. Struts 1 uses ActionServlet as a controller and Struts 2 uses FilterDispatcher as a controller. Struts 1 supports only JSP as a view technology and Struts 2 supports JSP, FreeMarker, and Velocity as view technologies. Struts 1 is not thread-safe and Struts 2 is thread-safe. Struts 1 is slower because it creates a new instance for each request and Struts 2 is faster because it uses the same instance for each request. Struts 1 supports only XML-based configuration and Struts 2 supports both XML and annotation-based configuration.

## Q: What is the difference between Struts 2 and Spring MVC?

**Struts 2** and **Spring MVC** are both popular Java web frameworks that follow the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern, but they have significant differences in architecture, features, and usage. Here's a clear comparison:

---

### 1. **Framework Origin**

| Feature        | Struts 2                         | Spring MVC                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Developer      | Apache Software Foundation       | Spring Framework by Pivotal/VMware   |
| Base Framework | Based on WebWork (MVC framework) | Part of the broader Spring Framework |

---

### 2. **Architecture and Configuration**

| Feature                    | Struts 2                        | Spring MVC                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Configuration              | Mostly XML-based (`struts.xml`) | Annotation-based and XML both supported |
| Inversion of Control (IoC) | Not built-in                    | Built-in with Spring IoC container      |
| Dependency Injection       | External support required       | Native and core feature of Spring       |

---

### 3. **Controller Design**

| Feature          | Struts 2                        | Spring MVC                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Action Classes   | One class per action            | One controller can handle many URLs    |
| Request Handling | Uses interceptors               | Uses handler mappings and interceptors |
| Method Mapping   | All logic in `execute()` method | Maps to methods via `@RequestMapping`  |

---

### 4. **Ease of Use and Development**

| Feature            | Struts 2                      | Spring MVC                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Development Style  | More configuration, XML-heavy | Lightweight, less configuration needed                |
| Annotation Support | Partial (limited)             | Full annotation support (`@Controller`, `@Autowired`) |

---

### 5. **Integration and Ecosystem**

| Feature     | Struts 2                                       | Spring MVC                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integration | Can be integrated with Spring, Hibernate, etc. | Natively integrates with Spring features                               |
| Ecosystem   | Focused on web layer                           | Part of a complete application framework (security, data, batch, etc.) |

---

### 6. **Validation and Interceptors**

| Feature      | Struts 2                           | Spring MVC                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Validation   | Uses XML or Annotations (`@Valid`) | Uses Spring Validator or JSR-303 (`@Valid`) |
| Interceptors | Core part of request processing    | Available but not as central as in Struts 2 |

---

### 7. **Popularity and Modern Use**

| Feature           | Struts 2               | Spring MVC                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |

| Community Support | Smaller, fewer updates | Large, active community           |
